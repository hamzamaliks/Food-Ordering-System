# Food-Ordering-System

Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to develop a food ordering system that can be used to transform the traditional ordering system. Generally, in restaurants menu order system is actual provided in menu card format so the customer must select the menu item then the waiter must come and take the order, which is a long processing method. So, we design Food Ordering System that displays food items for customers on their available devices such as user phone, Tablet etc. to give input their orders directly by touching. The system automatically completes data display, receiving, sending, storage of data and analysis. It is providing many advantages as great user-friendly, saving time, portability, reduce human error, flexibility and provide customer feedback etc. This system required large numbers of manpower to handle customer reservation, ordering food, reminding dishes of customer. “Intelligent Automated Restaurant” it is all about getting all of your different touchpoints working together connected, sharing information, speeding processes and personalizing experiences. E-menu is an interactive ordering system with new digital menu for customers.

Solution Approach:

The digital world is vast, with limitless boundary. And it does not have to make anyone wait. And that's the very reason, we have decided to make a food ordering system. This           done by using Python. The menu is programmed at backend to be displayed to user. Queue Data Structure is used to take the order and dispatch it to costumers by using First-In-First-Out method. The software generates the bill as well.

Project Features:

Operating System: Windows

IDE(s): Google Colaborat0ry

Data Structure: Queue

Programming Language: Python



Data Structure:

Queue Data Structure is used in our project, due to the real-life depiction of food ordering system. When the customer(user) places an order, he or she has to wait to get the order. Order placing is done by enqueue function and dispatchment of order is done by dequeue.
 	Time Complexity:

	The time complexity of enqueuing and dequeuing single order item O (1).
	The time complexity of enqueuing and dequeuing multiple order item O(n).


Functional specification:

Food ordering software is having many modules, which make the software more efficient and user friendly.

Modules:

	Main Menu
	Food items
	Drinks item
	Desserts
	Check cart
	Payment
